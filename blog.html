             <p><span>Naija Soccer Star Unveils Kanu Nwankwo As Face of Sport TV Reality Show

A sport reality tv show Naija soccer star has unveiled Nigerian former professional footballer Kanu Nwankwo as the face of the first edition of a sports reality show which is to start on 9th of August 2021.

Speaking at the press briefing which took place at the Kanu Heart Foundation Ikeja, the organizers said that the aim of the reality TV show is to give hope to millions of Nigerian footballers who aspires for greater height just as Kanu Nwankwo in his football career.

In his welcome address the Managing Director of Alphagrace Media Resources, Mr. Rupert Ojenuwa said that Kanu Nwanko has always wanted to give back to the society having opened the Kanu Heart Foundation at a very early age in his football career, which makes it a major decider for making him the face of Naija Soccer Star.</span>

<span>“This is the unveiling of the face of the Naija soccer star, we have many Nigerian youths with great, golden and rare talents in football. A lot of them look forward to a day they can become stars, so many of them are wallowing and waiting for that opportunity to present itself so that they can make great impact to the society. This is why we are partnering with Kindness Guild Nigeria, the initiator of this project to promote the programme and ensure that our youths do have a future.

In this quest we thought to bring in someone who this people know very well, whose story is from grass to grace and that is none other than the legendary Kanu Nwankwo and that is why we are here to unnnveil him as the face of Naija Soccer Star.

We chose him because he has always wanted to give back to the society having opened the Kanu Heart Foundation at a very early age in his career.” He said.</span>

<span>Also speaking the president of Kindness Guild Nigeria, Prince Yomi Otukoya said that the aim of the event is to make sure that the younger generations are better fixed.</span></p><br>

<p><span>“ We are here to make sure that our younger generation are better fixed, we are looking at sports, espescailly football as a major tool to transform the generation coming after us. <img class="f" src="resources/img/kanur.jpeg" alt="Portland">We are happy that the face of the project is the global ambassador Kanu Nwankwo. Kanu Heart Foundation is a member of world kindness movement so the journey is a smooth one.” He said

In his reaction the ace footballer Kanu Nwankwo said that this is a rare opportunity for the people on the street to be successful in their football career.



“I’m very happy to be here because a wonderful thing is about to happen, there are a lot of people in the street that wants to play soccer, a lot of people want to be PAPILO. This is a rare opportunity for them. Many people want to be successful but they don’t really understand what it takes to be there. Not only that they don’t have the opportunity or chance to make it to where they want to be.

I think the reality show is something that not only I will have to decide but the whole country will decide on who will be the best.</span>

<span>This is a very good platform for me to showcase whatever is hidden that needs to be out there. In this show everything is open it is important that we give this young people the hope and the opportunity that they can make it and show them that there are a lot of ways  that once can become successful in life." He said.</span></p>
